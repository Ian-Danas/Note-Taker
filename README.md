If running from the command line the user will first need to clone the the repository code onto their own machine. From there they will need to install all the dependencies included in the package.json file by running the "npm -i" in the commands line. From there they can run the index.js file in the terminal to run the program by calling the command "node index.js" this will start the server side from there they can go to the locally hosted website to use the application.
